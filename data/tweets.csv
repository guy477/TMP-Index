senator schumer more than a year longer than any other administration in history these are people who have been approved by committees and all others yet schumer continues to hold them back from serving their country! very unfair!
heads of countries are calling wanting to know why senator schumer is not approving their otherwise approved ambassadors!? likewise in government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from
it’s incredible how democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a wall doesn’t work it does and properly built almost 100%! they say it’s old technology - but so is the wheel they now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!
i’m in the oval office democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall you voted yes in 2006 and 2013 one more yes but with me in office i’ll get it built and fast!

i am the only person in america who could say that “i’m bringing our great troops back home with victory” and get bad press it is fake news and pundits who have failed for years that are doing the complaining if i stayed in endless wars forever they would still be unhappy!
i campaigned on border security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful wall our southern border has long been an “open wound” where drugs criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our country dems should get back here an fix now!
except the results are far better than i ever said they were going to be! i campaigned against the never ending wars remember!
i campaigned on getting out of syria and other places now when i start getting out the fake news media or some failed generals who were unable to do the job before i arrived like to complain about me &amp; my tactics which are working just doing what i said i was going to do!
if anybody but donald trump did what i did in syria which was an isis loaded mess when i became president they would be a national hero isis is mostly gone we’re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families while at the same time fighting isis remnants
an all concrete wall was never abandoned as has been reported by the media some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides) makes sense to me!
president and mrs obama built/has a ten foot wall around their dc mansion/compound i agree totally necessary for their safety and security the us needs the same thing slightly larger version!
great work by my administration over the holidays to save coast guard pay during this #schumershutdown no thanks to the democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of americans!
veterans on president trump’s handling of border security - 62% approval rating on being a strong leader - 59%  ap poll thank you!
“it turns out to be true now that the department of justice and the fbi under president obama rigged the investigation for hillary and really turned the screws on trump and now it looks like in a corrupt &amp; illegal way the facts are out now whole hoax exposed @jessebwatters
“absolutely nothing” (on russian collusion) kimberley strassel the wall street journal the russian collusion fabrication is the greatest hoax in the history of american politics the only russian collusion was with hillary and the democrats!
2018 is being called “the year of the worker” by steve moore co-author of “trumponomics” it was indeed a great year for the american worker with the “best job market in 50 years and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and hispanics and all workers big wage gains”
for those that naively ask why didn’t the republicans get approval to build the wall over the last year it is because in the senate we need 10 democrat votes and they will gives us “none” for border security! now we have to do it the hard way with a shutdown too bad! @foxnews
children in question were very sick before they were given over to border patrol the father of the young girl said it was not their fault he hadn’t given her water in days border patrol needs the wall and it will all end they are working so hard &amp; getting so little credit!
any deaths of children or others at the border are strictly the fault of the democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally they can’t if we had a wall they wouldn’t even try! the two
just had a long and very good call with president xi of china deal is moving along very well if made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute big progress being made!
i am in the white house waiting for the democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security from what i hear they are spending so much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!
the mueller angry democrats recently deleted approximately 19000 text messages between fbi agent lisa page and her lover agent peter s these texts were asked for and invaluable to the truth of the witch hunt hoax this is a total obstruction of justice all texts demanded!
thank you to sean parnell for the nice comments on @foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to melania and i in iraq and germany great things are happening!
honduras guatemala and el salvador are doing nothing for the united states but taking our money word is that a new caravan is forming in honduras and they are doing nothing about it we will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of us for years!
close the southern border bring our car industry back into the united states where it belongs go back to pre-nafta before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to mexico either we build (finish) the wall or we close the border
the united states looses soooo much money on trade with mexico under nafta over 75 billion dollars a year (not including drug money which would be many times that amount) that i would consider closing the southern border a “profit making operation” we build a wall or
we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall &amp; also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with hard to believe there was a congress &amp; president who would approve!
cnn &amp; others within the fake news universe were going wild about my signing maga hats for our military in iraq and germany if these brave young people ask me to sign their hat i will sign can you imagine my saying no? we brought or gave no hats as the fake news first reported!
this isn’t about the wall everybody knows that a wall will work perfectly (in israel the wall works 999%) this is only about the dems not letting donald trump &amp; the republicans have a win they may have the 10 senate votes but we have the issue border security 2020!
brad blakeman: “the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them the president says look this is your neighborhood you’ve got to stand up to protect yourselves don’t always look to america”

i totally agree! https://tco/ko8e3bfwfn
there is right now a full scale manhunt going on in california for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop time to get tough on border security build the wall!
“border patrol agents want the wall” democrat’s say they don’t want the wall (even though they know it is really needed) and they don’t want ice they don’t have much to campaign on do they? an open southern border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!
the reason the daca for wall deal didn’t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supreme court case after ruling dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall
the democrats obstruction of the desperately needed wall where they almost all recently agreed it should be built is exceeded only by their obstruction of 350 great people wanting &amp; expecting to come into government after being delayed for more than two years a us record!
the reason the daca for wall deal didn’t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supteme court case after ruling dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall
have the democrats finally realized that we desperately need border security and a wall on the southern border need to stop drugs human traffickinggang members &amp; criminals from coming into our country do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats?

i am all alone (poor me) in the white house waiting for the democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security at some point the democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about crazy!
saudi arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild syria instead of the united states see? isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a great country the us that is 5000 miles away thanks to saudi a!
the wall is different than the 25 billion dollars in border security the complete wall will be built with the shutdown money plus funds already in hand the reporting has been inaccurate on the point the problem is without the wall much of the rest of dollars are wasted!
i never “lashed out” at the acting attorney general of the us a man for whom i have great respect this is a made up story one of many by the fake news media!
the only problem our economy has is the fed they don’t have a feel for the market they don’t understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch - he can’t putt!
america is respected again!
for all of the sympathizers out there of brett mcgurk remember he was the obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 18 billion dollars in cash &amp;  sending it to iran as part of the horrific iran nuclear deal (now terminated) approved by little bob corker
we are substantially subsidizing the militaries of many very rich countries all over the world while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the us and our taxpayers on trade general mattis did not see this as a problem i do and it is being fixed!
to those few senators who think i don’t like or appreciate being allied with other countries they are wrong i do what i don’t like however is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the united states both in military protection and trade
virtually every democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a border wall or fence it was only when i made it an important part of my campaign because people and drugs were pouring into our country unchecked that they turned against it desperately needed!
president @rt_erdogan of turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of isis in syriaand he is a man who can do it plus turkey is right “next door” our troops are coming home!
“the president has been remarkable i do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is” thank you to tammy bruce and steve hilton presidential harassment has been with me from the beginning!
the most important way to stop gangs drugs human trafficking and massive crime is at our southern border we need border security and as everyone knows you can’t have border security without a wall the drones &amp; technology are just bells and whistles safety for america!
mitch mcconnell just told a group of people and me that he has been in the us senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best &amp; most productive of his career tax &amp; regulation cuts va choice farm bill criminal justice reform judgeships &amp; much more great!

bob corker was responsible for giving us the horrible iran nuclear deal which i ended yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement i said no and the game was over #maga i love tennessee!
senator bob corker just stated that “i’m so priveledged to serve in the senate for twelve years and that’s what i told the people of our state that’s what i’d do serve for two terms” but that is not true - wanted to run but poll numbers tanked when i wouldn’t endorse him
we signed two pieces of major legislation this week criminal justice reform and the farm bill these are two big deals but all the fake news media wants to talk about is “the mistake” of bringing our young people back home from the never ending wars it all began 19 years ago!
unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in indonesia more than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for we are praying for recovery and healing america is with you!
i just had a long and productive call with president @rt_erdogan of turkey we discussed isis our mutual involvement in syria &amp; the slow &amp; highly coordinated pullout of us troops from the area after many years they are coming home we also discussed heavily expanded trade
i am pleased to announce that our very talented deputy secretary of defense patrick shanahan will assume the title of acting secretary of defense starting january 1 2019 patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as deputy &amp; previously boeing he will be great!
the only way to stop drugs gangs human trafficking criminal elements and much else from coming into our country is with a wall or barrier drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun but it is only a good old fashioned wall that works!
when president obama ingloriously fired jim mattis i gave him a second chance some thought i shouldn’t i thought i should interesting relationship-but i also gave all of the resources that he never really had allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of us
if anybody but your favorite president donald j trump announced that after decimating isis in syria we were going to bring our troops back home (happy &amp; healthy) that person would be the most popular hero in america with me hit hard instead by the fake news media crazy!
brett mcgurk who i do not know was appointed by president obama in 2015 was supposed to leave in february but he just resigned prior to leaving grandstander? the fake news is making such a big deal about this nothing event!

shutdown today if democrats do not vote for border security!
house republican vote 217-185
the democrats whose votes we need in the senate will probably vote against border security and the wall even though they know it is desperately needed if the dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time people don’t want open borders and crime!
no matter what happens today in the senate republican house members should be very proud of themselves they flew back to washington from all parts of the world in order to vote for border security and the wall not one democrat voted yes and we won big i am very proud of you!
on a border is only effective in conjunction with a wall properly designed and built walls work and the democrats are lying when they say they don’t in israel the wall is 999% successful will not be any different on our southern border! hundreds of $billions saved!
the democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a wall calling it old fashioned the fact is there is nothing else’s that will work and that has been true for thousands of years it’s like the wheel there is nothing better i know tech better than anyone &amp; technology
senator mitch mcconnell should fight for the wall and border security as hard as he fought for anything he will need democrat votes but as shown in the house good things happen if enough dems don’t vote it will be a democrat shutdown! house republicans were great yesterday!
soon to be speaker nancy pelosi said last week live from the oval office that the republicans didn’t have the votes for border security today the house republicans voted and won 217-185 nancy does not have to apologize all i want is great border security!

never in the history of our country has the “press” been more dishonest than it is today stories that should be good are bad stories that should be bad are horrible many stories like with the real story on russia clinton &amp; the dnc seldom get reported too bad!

if it was a conservative that said what “crazed” mika brzezinski stated on her show yesterday using a certain horrible term that person would be banned permanently from television
witch hunt!
they gave general flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated - the fbi said he didn’t lie and they overrode the fbi they want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements sad!
guilty even on a civil basis those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook as a lawyer michael has great liability to me!

i often stated “one way or the other mexico is going to pay for the wall” this has never changed our new deal with mexico (and canada) the usmca is so much better than the old very costly &amp; anti-usa nafta deal that just by the money we save mexico is paying for the wall!
@flotus melania will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight on @foxnews at 9:00pme!
the democrats and president obama gave iran 150 billion dollars and got nothing but they can’t give 5 billion dollars for national security and a wall?
another very bad terror attack in france we are going to strengthen our borders even more chuck and nancy must give us the votes to get additional border security!
thanks to leader mcconnell for agreeing to bring a senate vote on criminal justice this week! these historic changes will make communities safer and save tremendous taxpayers dollars it brings much needed hope to many families during the holiday season
"“i don’t care what you think of the presidentit cannot bleed over to the fbicomey is confirming there is bias in the fbi” 
-chris swecker"
james comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow democrats to take back the white house in 2020 in other words he is and has been a democrat comey had no right heading the fbi at any time but especially after his mind exploded!
fake news has it purposely wrong many over ten are vying for and wanting the white house chief of staff position why wouldn’t someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in washington please report news correctly thank you!
very productive conversations going on with china! watch for some important announcements!
great job by michael anton on @foxandfriends a true national security expert!
people do not yet realize how much of the wall including really effective renovation has already been built if the democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country the military will build the remaining sections of the wall they know how important it is!
i look forward to my meeting with chuck schumer &amp; nancy pelosi in 2006 democrats voted for a wall and they were right to do so today they no longer want border security they will fight it at all cost and nancy must get votes for speaker but the wall will get built
however for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left do not want border security they want open borders for anyone to come in this brings large scale crime and disease our southern border is now secure and will remain that way
ice border patrol and our military have done a fantastic job of securing our southern border a great wall would be however a far easier &amp; less expensive solution we have already built large new sections &amp; fully renovated others making them like new the democrats
despite the large caravans that were forming and heading to our country people have not been able to get through our newly built walls makeshift walls &amp; fences or border patrol officers &amp; military they are now staying in mexico or going back to their original countries
“former fbi director james comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the democrats paid for that phony trump dossier” @loudobbs  details on tuesday night
james comey’s behind closed doors testimony reveals that “there was not evidence of campaign collusion” with russia when he left the fbi in other words the witch hunt is illegal and should never have been started!
which it was not (but even if it was it is only a civil case like obama’s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine lawyer’s liability if he made a mistake not me) cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced witch hunt!
“democrats can’t find a smocking gun tying the trump campaign to russia after james comey’s testimony no smocking gunno collusion” @foxnews  that’s because there was no collusion so now the dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution
i am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of white house chief of staff fake news has been saying with certainty it was nick ayers a spectacular person who will always be with our #maga agenda i will be making a decision soon!
the trump administration has accomplished more than any other us administration in its first two (not even) years of existence &amp; we are having a great time doing it! all of this despite the fake news media which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the enemy of the people!
leakin’ james comey must have set a record for who lied the most to congress in one day his friday testimony was so untruthful! this whole deal is a rigged fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that i could not become president they are now exposed!
on 245  occasions former fbi director james comey told house investigators he didn’t know didn’t recall or couldn’t remember things when asked opened investigations on 4 americans (not 2) - didn’t know who signed off and didn’t know christopher steele all lies!

very sad day &amp; night in paris maybe it’s time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive paris agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes? the us was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year!

it has been incorrectly reported that rudy giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the mueller report that is fake news already 87 pages done but obviously cannot complete until we see the final witch hunt report
china talks are going very well!

robert mueller and leakin’ lyin’ james comey are best friends just one of many mueller conflicts of interest and bye the way wasn’t the woman in charge of prosecuting jerome corsi (who i do not know) in charge of “legal” at the corrupt clinton foundation? a total witch hunt
arizona together with our military and border patrol is bracing for a massive surge at a non-walled area we will not let them through big danger nancy and chuck must approve boarder security and the wall!
fake news - the enemy of the people!
trish_regan:  “did the fbi follow protocol to obtain the fisa warrant? i don’t think so the dossier was opposition research funded by opponents don’t use government resources to take down political foes weaponizing government for gain” is this really america? witch hunt!
jerome corsi: ”this is not justice this is not america this is a political prosecution the special prosecutor (counsel) to get this plea deal demanded i lie and violate the law they’re the criminals” he is not alone 17 angry dems people forced to lie sad!  @trish_regan
statement from china: “the teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other we are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days” i agree!
does the fake news media ever mention the fact that republicans with the very important help of my campaign rallies won the united states senate 53 to 47? all i hear is that the open border dems won the house senate alone approves judges &amp; others big republican win!
my thoughts and prayers are with the @usmc crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of japan thank you to @usforcesjapan for their immediate response and rescue efforts whatever you need we are here for you @iiimef
without the phony russia witch hunt and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (tax &amp; regulation cuts judge’s military vets etc) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by rasmussen it’s called presidential harassment!

considered to be the worst and most dangerous addictive and deadly substance of them all last year over 77000 people died from fentanyl if china cracks down on this “horror drug” using the death penalty for distributors and pushers the results will be incredible!
one of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with president xi of china is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly fentanyl coming into the united states it will now be considered a “controlled substance” this could be a game changer on what is
very strong signals being sent by china once they returned home from their long trip including stops from argentina not to sound naive or anything but i believe president xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting all subjects discussed!
china had agreed to start “immediately” buying us products” @business
“china officially echoed president donald trump’s optimism over bilateral trade talks chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of us soybeans &amp; liquified natural gas the first sign confirming the claims of president donald trump and the white house that
china does not want tariffs!
we are either going to have a real deal with china or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major tariffs against chinese product being shipped into the united states ultimately i believe we will be making a deal - either now or into the future
in the world i want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving america’s environment but american taxpayers – and american workers – shouldn’t pay to clean up others countries’ pollution

but if a fair deal is able to be made with china one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done i will happily sign let the negotiations begin make america great again!
i am a tariff man when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so it will always be the best way to max out our economic power we are right now taking in $billions in tariffs make america rich again
on seeing whether or not a real deal with china is actually possible if it is we will get it done china is supposed to start buying agricultural product and more immediately president xi and i want this deal to happen and it probably will but if not remember

bob mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of angry democrats don’t want the truth they only want lies the truth is very bad for their mission!
“i will never testify against trump” this statement was recently made by roger stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about “president trump” nice to know that some people still have “guts!”
his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off scott free he lied for this outcome and should in my opinion serve a full and complete sentence
“michael cohen asks judge for no prison time” you mean he can do all of the terrible unrelated to trump things having to do with fraud big loans taxis etc and not serve a long prison term? he makes up stories to get a great &amp; already reduced deal for himself and get
we would save billions of dollars if the democrats would give us the votes to build the wall either way people will not be allowed into our country illegally! we will close the entire southern border if necessary also stop the drugs!
i am certain that at some time in the future president xi and i together with president putin of russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable arms race the us spent 716 billion dollars this year crazy!
president xi and i have a very strong and personal relationship he and i are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great nations a solution for north korea is a great thing for china and all!
farmers will be a a very big and fast beneficiary of our deal with china they intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately we make the finest and cleanest product in the world and that is what china wants farmers i love you!
my meeting in argentina with president xi of china was an extraordinary one relations with china have taken a big leap forward! very good things will happen we are dealing from great strength but china likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed level the field!
china has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into china from the us currently the tariff is 40%

in the 2016 election i was winning by so much in florida that broward county which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a “number” couldn’t do it because not enough people live in broward for them to falsify a victory!

check out tweets from last two days i refer to fake news media when mentioning enemy of the people - but dishonest reporters use only the word “media” the people of our great country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much fake news they get it and fully understand!
cnn and others in the fake news business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that i said the “media is the enemy of the people” wrong! i said that the “fake news (media) is the enemy of the people” a very big difference when you give out false information - not good!

there is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open &amp; obvious hostility &amp; report the news accurately &amp; fairly that will do much to put out the flame
the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame republicans conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country actually it is their fake &amp; dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand!

michael cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime president obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!
a large number of counts ten could not even be decided in the paul manafort case witch hunt!
i feel very badly for paul manafort and his wonderful family “justice” took a 12 year old tax case among other things applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike michael cohen he refused to “break” - make up stories in order to get a “deal” such respect for a brave man!
if anyone is looking for a good lawyer i would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of michael cohen!

big rally tonight in west virginia patrick morrisey is running a great race for us senate i have done so much for west virginia against all odds and having patrick a real fighter by my side would make things so much easier see you later clean coal!!!!
i am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the border into the united states illegally! if there were no serious consequences our country would be overrun with people trying to get in and our system could not handle it!
fake news of which there is soooo much (this time the very tired new yorker) falsely reported that i was going to take the extraordinary step of denying intelligence briefings to president obama never discussed or thought of!
even james clapper has admonished john brennan for having gone totally off the rails maybe clapper is being nice to me so he doesn’t lose his security clearance for lying to congress!
a blue wave means crime and open borders a red wave means safety and strength!
i am hearing so many great things about the republican party’s california gubernatorial candidate john cox he is a very successful businessman who is tired of high taxes &amp; crime he will make california great again &amp;  make you proud of your great state again total endorsement!

it is outrageous that poisonous synthetic heroin fentanyl comes pouring into the us postal system from china we can and must end this now! the senate should pass the stop act – and firmly stop this poison from killing our children and destroying our country no more delay!
“bruce ohr is at the center of false allegations which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didn’t happen” darrell issa house oversight we can take out the word “apparently”  @foxnews
will bruce ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited dossier ever be fired from the jeff sessions  “justice” department? a total joke!
everybody wants to keep their security clearance it’s worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan it certainly isn’t because of the good job he did! he is a political “hack”
i hope john brennan the worst cia director in our country’s history brings a lawsuit it will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt he won’t sue!
where’s the collusion? they made up a phony crime called collusion and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed) if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt they scream obstruction!
looking for trouble they are enjoying ruining people’s lives and refuse to look at the real corruption on the democrat side - the lies the firings the deleted emails and soooo much more! mueller’s angry dems are looking to impact the election they are a national disgrace!
disgraced and discredited bob mueller and his whole group of angry democrat thugs spent over 30 hours with the white house councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency anybody needing that much time when they know there is no russian collusion is just someone
study the late joseph mccarthy because we are now in period with mueller and his gang that make joseph mccarthy look like a baby! rigged witch hunt!
some members of the media are very angry at the fake story in the new york times they actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward from the day i announced the times has been fake news and with their disgusting new board member it will only get worse!
the failing new york times wrote a story that made it seem like the white house councel had turned on the president when in fact it is just the opposite - &amp; the two fake reporters knew this this is why the fake news media has become the enemy of the people so bad for america!
no collusion and no obstruction except by crooked hillary and the democrats all of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted bob mueller refuses to even look in that direction what about the brennan comey mccabe strzok lies to congress or crooked’s emails!
and have demanded transparency so that this rigged and disgusting witch hunt can come to a close so many lives have been ruined over nothing - mccarthyism at its worst! yet mueller &amp; his gang of dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - media is even worse!
the failing @nytimes wrote a fake piece today implying that because white house councel don mcgahn was giving hours of testimony to the special councel he must be a john dean type “rat” but i allowed him and all others to testify - i didn’t have to i have nothing to hide
i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn and all other requested members of the white house staff to fully cooperate with the special counsel in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents most transparent in history no collusion no obstruction witch hunt!
i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn and all other requested members of the white house staff to fully cooperate with the special councel in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents most transparent in history no collusion no obstruction witch hunt!
the united states has ended the ridiculous 230 million dollar yearly development payment to syria saudi arabia and other rich countries in the middle east will start making payments instead of the us i want to develop the us our military and countries that help us!

the economy is stronger and better than ever before importantly there remains tremendous potential - it will only get better with time!
great job  rachel campos-duffy on @foxandfriends
has anyone looked at the mistakes that john brennan made while serving as cia director? he will go down as easily the worst in history &amp; since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!
https://tco/5kir5eggbp
all of the fools that are so focused on looking only at russia should start also looking in another direction china but in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone!
too many voices are being destroyed some good &amp; some bad and that cannot be allowed to happen who is making the choices because i can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made let everybody participate good &amp; bad and we will all just have to figure it out!
censorship is a very dangerous thing &amp; absolutely impossible to police if you are weeding out fake news there is nothing so fake as cnn &amp; msnbc &amp; yet i do not ask that their sick behavior be removed i get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or don’t watch at all
social media is totally discriminating against republican/conservative voices speaking loudly and clearly for the trump administration we won’t let that happen they are closing down the opinions of many people on the right while at the same time doing nothing to others
financial gain is a federal gratuity statute violation bribery statute violation honest services violationall major crimesbecause the doj is run by blank jeff sessions”  gregg jarrett  so when does mueller do what must be done? probably never! @foxnews
“bruce ohr of doj is in legal jeopardy it’s astonishing that he’s still employed bruce &amp; nelly ohr’s bank account is getting fatter &amp; fatter because of the dossier that they are both peddling he doesn’t disclose it under fed regs using your federal office for personal

“fox news has learned that bruce ohr wrote christopher steele following the firing of james comey saying that he was afraid the anti-trump russia probe will be exposed”  charles payne  @foxbusiness   how much more does mueller have to see? they have blinders on - rigged!
https://tco/tmicruv9uo
i say andrew’s was a bigger and more incompetent blunder he should easily win his race against a super liberal actress but his political career is over!
which is worse hightax andrew cuomo's statement “we’re not going to make america great again it was never that great” or hillary clinton’s “deplorables” statement
when a politician admits that “we’re not going to make america great again” there doesn’t seem to be much reason to ever vote for him this could be a career threatening statement by andrew cuomo with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother chris!
wow! big pushback on governor andrew cuomo of new york for his really dumb statement about america’s lack of greatness i have already made america great again just look at the markets jobs military- setting records and we will do even better andrew “choked” badly mistake!

the local politicians who run washington dc (poorly) know a windfall when they see it when asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that i cancelled it never let someone hold you up! i will instead
how does a politician cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the us survive making the statement we’re not going to make america great again it was never that great? which section of the sentence is worse?
in speaking with some of the world’s top business leaders i asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the us “stop quarterly reporting &amp; go to a six month system” said one that would allow greater flexibility &amp; save money i have asked the sec to study!
released in 2017 if his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office it constitutes an intelligence breach”  richard burr (r-nc) senate intel cmte chair  @loudobbs
“director brennan’s recent statements purport to know as fact that the trump campaign colluded with a foreign power if director brennan’s statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the cia why didn’t he include it in the intelligence community assessment
“an incredibly corrupt fbi &amp; doj trying to steer the outcome of a presidential election brennan has gone off the deep end he’s disgraced and discredited himself his conduct has been outrageous” chris farrell judicial watch
how can “senator” richard blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a connecticut politician bragging that he was a great marine war hero in vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a marine nor ever in vietnam) pass judgement on anyone? loser!
@tuckercarlson speaking of john brennan: “how did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be cia director in the first place?” now that is a really good question! then followed by “richard blumenthal of connecticut is a fake war hero” so true a total fake!
“very concerned about comey’s firing afraid they will be exposed” said bruce ohr doj’s emails &amp; notes show bruce ohr’s connection to (phony &amp; discredited) trump dossier a creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act rigged witch hunt!
“while steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a russian oligarch”  catherine herridge of @foxnews  @loudobbs  in other words they were colluding with russia!
“the fbi received documents from bruce ohr (of the justice department &amp; whose wife nelly worked for fusion gps)” disgraced and fired fbi agent peter strzok this is too crazy to be believed! the rigged witch hunt has zero credibility
turkey has taken advantage of the united states for many years they are now holding our wonderful christian pastor who i must now ask to represent our country as a great patriot hostage we will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man but we are cutting back on turkey!

there is nothing that i would want more for our country than true freedom of the press the fact is that the press is free to write and say anything it wants but much of what it says is fake news pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people honesty wins!
the boston globe which was sold to the the failing new york times for 13 billion dollars (plus 800 million dollars in losses &amp; investment) or 21 billion dollars was then sold by the times for 1 dollar now the globe is in collusion with other papers on free press prove it!

lou dobbs: “this cannot go forwardthis special counsel with all of his conflicts with his 17 angry democrats without any evidence of collusion by the trump campaign and russia the dems are the ones who should be investigated” thank you lou so true!
strzok started the illegal rigged witch hunt - why isn’t this so-called “probe” ended immediately? why aren’t these angry and conflicted democrats instead looking at crooked hillary?
fired fbi agent peter strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started there was no collusion or obstruction with russia and everybody including the democrats know it the only collusion and obstruction was by crooked hillary the democrats and the dnc!
“they were all in on it clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump for things he didn’t do” gregg jarrett on @foxandfriends  if we had a real attorney general this witch hunt would never have been started! looking at the wrong people

guy was corrupt and had anti-trump animus strzok and others at the fbi should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation instead mueller is pretending nothing went wrong he used strzok he used the clinton dnc dossierthe whole thing
tom fitton of judicial watch: “the strzok firing is as much about the mueller operation as anything else there would be no mueller special councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of strzok &amp; his colleagues at the top levels of the fbi we know this

too bad a large portion of the media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the rigged witch hunt - but that is why we call them fake news!
why aren’t mueller and the 17 angry democrats looking at the meetings concerning the fake dossier and all of the lying that went on in the fbi and doj? this is the most one sided witch hunt in the history of our country fortunately the facts are all coming out and fast!
fake news reporting a complete fabrication that i am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son donald had in trump tower this was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere i did not know about it!
because of tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt that has been accumulated much by the obama administration while at the same time reducing taxes for our people at minimum we will make much better trade deals for our country!
tariffs are working big time every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the us always to our detriment i say as they cometax them if they don’t want to be taxed let them make or build the product in the us in either event it means jobs and great wealth

china which is for the first time doing poorly against us is spending a fortune on ads and pr trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on tariffs- because they are really hurting their economy likewise other countries we are winning but must be strong!
tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today only fools would disagree we are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of tariffs we win either way
tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our steel industry plants are opening all over the us steelworkers are working again and big dollars are flowing into our treasury other countries use tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream!
tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated china market has dropped 27% in last 4months and they are talking to us our market is stronger than ever and will go up dramatically when these horrible trade deals are successfully renegotiated america first

”carter page wasn’t a spy wasn’t an agent of the russians - he would have cooperated with the fbi it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump” tom fitton @judicialwatch a disgrace to america they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now!
and the doj fbi and obama gang need to be held to account source #1 was the major source avoided talking about it being the clinton campaign behind it misled the court to provide a pretext to spy on the trump team not about carter pagewas all about getting trump
“it was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team this is a clinton campaign document it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump
so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc that was knowingly &amp; falsely submitted to fisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited mueller witch hunt!
tom fitton on @foxandfriends at 6:15 am now! judicial watch
to iranian president rouhani: never ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence &amp; death be cautious!
so president obama knew about russia before the election why didn’t he do something about it? why didn’t he tell our campaign? because it is all a big hoax that’s why and he thought crooked hillary was going to win!!!

@petehegseth on @foxnews  “source #1 was the (fake) dossier yes the dirty dossier paid for by democrats as a hit piece against trump and looking for information that could discredit candidate #1 trump carter page was just the foot to surveil the trump campaign” illegal!
andrew mccarthy - “i said this could never happen this is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it it is so bad it screams out at you”  on the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch hunt!
looking more &amp; more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc ask her how that worked out - she did better with crazy bernie republicans must get tough now an illegal scam!
congratulations to @judicialwatch and @tomfitton on being successful in getting the carter page fisa documents as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of “justice” and fbi misled the courts witch hunt rigged a scam!

republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen/women in november dems are just playing games have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem we can pass great legislation after the red wave!
elect more republicans in  november and we will pass the finest fairest and most comprehensive immigration bills anywhere in the world right now we have the dumbest and the worst dems are doing nothing but obstructing remember their motto resist! ours is produce!
even if we get 100% republican votes in the senate we need 10 democrat votes to get a much needed immigration bill - &amp; the dems are obstructionists who won’t give votes for political reasons &amp; because they don’t care about crime coming from border! so we need to elect more r’s!

we must always arrest people coming into our country illegally of the 12000 children 10000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip and only 2000 are with their parents many of whom have tried to enter our country illegally on numerous occasions
democrats are the problem they don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our country like ms-13 they can’t win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters!
if you don’t have borders you don’t have a country!
crime in germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted others countries are even worse be smart america!

it is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration change the laws!
change the laws!
children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country has anyone been looking at the crime taking place south of the border it is historic with some countries the most dangerous places in the world not going to happen in the us
we don’t want what is happening with immigration in europe to happen with us!
the people of germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous berlin coalition crime in germany is way up big mistake made all over europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!
why don’t the democrats give us the votes to fix the world’s worst immigration laws? where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs including ms-13 coming into our country illegally?
“the highest level of bias i’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer” trey gowdy on the fbi’s own peter strzok also remember that they all worked for slippery james comey and that comey is best friends with robert mueller a really sick deal isn’t it?
the democrats should get together with their republican counterparts and work something out on border security &amp; safety don’t wait until after the election because you are going to lose!
why was the fbi’s sick loser peter strzok working on the totally discredited mueller team of 13 angry &amp; conflicted democrats when strzok was giving crooked hillary a free pass yet telling his lover lawyer lisa page that “we’ll stop” trump from becoming president? witch hunt!

schneiderman who ran the clinton campaign in new york never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case which lingered in their office for almost 2 years now he resigned his office in disgrace and his disciples brought it when we would not settle
the sleazy new york democrats and their now disgraced (and run out of town) ag eric schneiderman are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18800000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in $19200000 i won’t settle this case!
so the democrats make up a phony crime collusion with the russians pay a fortune to make the crime sound real illegally leak (comey) classified information so that a special councel will be appointed and then collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in fake news!

the obama administration is now accused of trying to give iran secret access to the financial system of the united states this is totally illegal perhaps we could get the 13 angry democrats to divert some of their energy to this “matter” (as comey would call it) investigate!
when will people start saying “thank you mr president for firing james comey?”
our justice department must not let awan &amp; debbie wasserman schultz off the hook the democrat it scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today they want to make a “plea deal” to hide what is on their server where is server? really bad!

how could jeff flake who is setting record low polling numbers in arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn’t have a clue) think about running for office even a lower one again? let’s face it he’s a flake!
when and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 angry democrats (plus) working on the witch hunt hoax there has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted it is all a democrat excuse for losing the election where is the server?

paul manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented ronald reagan bob dole &amp; many others over the years) but we should have been told that comey and the boys were doing a number on him and he wouldn’t have been hired!
as only one of two people left who could become president why wouldn’t the fbi or department of “justice” have told me that they were secretly investigating paul manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? should have told me!

this whole russia probe is rigged just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that haven’t been lost in decades 13 angry democrats and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for 8 years #spygate &amp; conflicts of interest!
with spies or “informants” as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not) all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the fbi or “justice” contact me to tell me of the  phony russia problem?
the failing @nytimes quotes “a senior white house official” who doesn’t exist as saying “even if the meeting were reinstated holding it on june 12 would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed” wrong again! use real people not phony sources
unlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to  how to deal with north koreaand if there was it wouldn’t matter the @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning!

good news about the release of the american hostage from venezuela should be landing in dc this evening and be in the white house with his family at about 7:00 pm the great people of utah will be very happy!
we are having very productive talks with north korea about reinstating the summit which if it does happen will likely remain in singapore on the same date june 12th and if necessary will be extended beyond that date
but complain and obstruct they made only bad deals (iran) and their so-called trade deals are the laughing stock of the world!
senator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase us parts and pay a $13 billion fine dems do nothing
funny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states lost almost $800 billion/year under “o”

very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from north korea we will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace only time (and talent) will tell!
democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea just like they are coming to the defense of ms 13 thugs saying that they are individuals &amp; must be nurtured or asking to end your big tax cuts &amp; raise your taxes instead dems have lost touch!
“everyone knows there was a spy and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spywidespread spying involving multiple people” mollie hemingway the federalist senior editor  but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster story!
can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? and to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money lost!
the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a spy as illegal as that may be but what about an “informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the russian hoax?
i will be making the commencment address today at the united states naval academy in annapolis maryland look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth!

look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state they go after phony collusion with russia a made up scam and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! what goes around comes around!
@foxandfriends  “new bombshell in the obama spying scandal did other agencies spy on trump campaign?” even clapper worlds dumbest former intelligence head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word spy when describing the illegal activities!
follow the money! the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia because there was no collusion he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win - just like they did to bernie sanders who got duped!
if the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal

china must continue to be strong &amp; tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in i want this to happen and north korea to be very successful but only after signing!

china has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional farm/agricultural products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
i ask senator chuck schumer why didn’t president obama &amp; the democrats do something about trade with china including theft of intellectual property etc? they did nothing! with that being said chuck &amp; i have long agreed on this issue! fair trade plus with china will happen!
i hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbi/doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration!

the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the world oh’ great!
and why hasn’t the podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington dc?
what ever happened to the server at the center of so much corruption that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of democrats) fbi? they broke into homes &amp; offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the server?
now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party don’t worry about dems fisa abuse missing emails or fraudulent dossier!
in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted 33000 emails got $145000000 while secretary of state paid mccabes wife $700000 (and got off the fbi hook along with terry m) and so much more republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam
at what point does this soon to be $20000000 witch hunt composed of 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for 8 years stop! they have found no collussion with russia no obstruction but they aren’t looking at the corruption
things are really getting ridiculous the failing and crooked (but not as crooked as hillary clinton) @nytimes has done a long &amp; boring story indicating that the world’s most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia &amp; me so now they are looking at the rest of the world!
if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee (also senate judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers drain the swamp!

why isn’t disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the $700000 crooked hillary democrats in virginia led by clinton best friend terry m (under fbi investigation that they killed) gave to mccabe’s wife in her run for office? then dropped case on clinton!

the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term “mission accomplished” i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term it should be brought back use often!
comey throws ag lynch “under the bus!” why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch? was she promised a supreme court seat or ag in order to lay off hillary no golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!
the big questions in comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like how come he gave up classified information (jail) why did he lie to congress (jail) why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi (why didn’t they take it) why the phony memos mccabe’s $700000 &amp; more?

now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats lead by their fearless leader crooked hillary clinton lost the 2016 election but wasn’t i a great candidate?
i never said russia did not meddle in the election i said “it may be russia or china or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer” the russian “hoax” was that the trump campaign colluded with russia - it never did!
finally liddle’ adam schiff the leakin’ monster of no control is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 election he is finally right about something obama was president knew of the threat and did nothing thank you adam!
never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send $17 billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress the fbi or justice called for an investigation!
general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h the dnc and the dems remember the dirty dossier uranium speeches emails and the podesta company!
very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter this is not acceptable they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign - there is no collusion get back to the basics and make us all proud!
